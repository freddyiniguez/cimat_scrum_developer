# Scrum Developer Course
## Verificaci贸n y Validaci贸n de Software
This repository has been created in order to develop all the activities related to the course: "Verificaci贸n y Validaci贸n de Software" at CIMAT Zacatecas.

## Server at Digital Ocean ("TDD")
To easily integrate all the activities and exercises demanded on Test-Driven Development with Python, [see the official blog here] (http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/) we have contracted a virtual machine with Ubuntu 14.04 at DigitalOcean.
Here's the URl to see progress: [TDD: PaulinaEscarcia, FreddyIniguez](https://159.203.110.192)

# Packages installed on server
## Distro's features: Linux Ubuntu 14.04 512GB RAM 20GB SSD
	* sudo apt-get install python3-pip 	// NOTE: Ubuntu already implement the third version of Python programming language, so it is not necessary to install it ;)
	* sudo pip3 install django==1.8 	// NOTE: We have read that the version 1.7 of django causes sone issues that 1.8 version does not, so we prefer to install this package instead the one recommended on the book. 
	* sudo pip3 install --upgrade selenium
