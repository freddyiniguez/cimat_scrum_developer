# CHAPTERS OVERVIEW
# THE PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT IS TO DESCRIBE A VERY SHORT OVERVIEW ABOUT THE CHAPTERS.

# CHAPTER I: Getting Django Set Up Using a Functional Test
	* In this chapter don't have problems and we introduce the basics of Test-Driven Development(TDD). 

# CHAPTER II: Extending Our Functional Test Using the unittest Module
	* We spent a lot of time looking for an error in the code, and the identation was incorrect. So we've decided to use the Python code standard flake8 and pep8.
	* We modified the code to implemented Python unittest.

# CHAPTER III: Testing a Simple Home Page with Unit Tests
	* We create a Django app: run UT and FT, views functions, request and response onjects and returning basic HTML. 

# CHAPTER IV: What Are We Doing with All These Tests?
	* We returned a HTML file using a Django template. Had an error-typing, but at the end took a look at author's sample book code and find the issue.

# CHAPTER V: Saving User Input
	*We have problems with identation and spaces, but resolve with autopep8 and work with post request, Django ORM and our first model, database migration and rendering items in the template
